The course shop app is a front-end project that I had done during my internship at Education4ol. 

In beginning the project has login and signin page which allows user to enter into a homepage. Homepage contains lots of features according to the tasks demand to make website more professional. 
Firstly from navbar , user can be targeted to his/her profile page where they can upload and edit their personal information. Moving further here is a link name My leaning which let the user to know about the courses that is complete and user can also download their certificate from that particular page. To make webpage more interesting and efficient I created another part from where user can know about courses which are yet to complete. Log out button at the end of navbar navigates to the login page. 

Moreover, in body I used bootstrap cards to display course details and two buttons are created on each course card to view course details and buy course. Pagination class is used to taget user to different pages. 

At last, footer is created to display address and social media handel's of course shop app. 

Overall the website is completely responsive and is created with the help of HTML, CSS and famous framework Bootstrap.
